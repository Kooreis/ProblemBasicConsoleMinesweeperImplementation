# Question: How do you implement a basic version of Minesweeper in the console? C# Summary

The provided C# code implements a basic version of the game Minesweeper in the console. The game is initialized with a 5x5 grid and 5 mines. The game continues in a loop, prompting the player to enter the row and column of the cell they wish to reveal. If the selected cell contains a mine, the game ends. If the cell does not contain a mine, the cell is revealed and the game continues. The board is printed after each move, with unrevealed cells displayed as a question mark. The board is initialized by randomly placing mines and then calculating the number of adjacent mines for each cell. The game is played in the console and does not have a graphical user interface.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the Minesweeper game is simpler and more concise than the C# version. This is mainly due to Python's built-in functions and its dynamic typing, which allows for more flexibility and less verbose code.

In the Python version, the board is created using list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists in Python. The board is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row on the board. The mines are placed on the board by generating random numbers and checking if they are already in the list of mines. The number of mines in the surrounding cells is calculated using nested for loops and the cells are updated accordingly.

The C# version, on the other hand, uses a class to represent the game and has separate methods for initializing the board, counting the mines, and printing the board. The board is a 2D array of characters and the mines are placed on the board by generating random row and column indices. The number of mines in the surrounding cells is calculated using nested for loops and the cells are updated accordingly.

The Python version does not have a play function like the C# version. Instead, it simply prints the board to the console after it is created. The C# version has a play function that prompts the user to enter the row and column of the cell they want to reveal and continues until the user selects a cell containing a mine.

In terms of language features, Python's list comprehension, dynamic typing, and built-in functions like `randint` and `join` make the code more concise and easier to read. C#, on the other hand, requires explicit type declarations and uses a class-based approach, which makes the code longer and more complex.

# Java Differences

The Java and C# versions of the Minesweeper game are quite similar in their overall structure and logic. Both versions create a game board, place mines on it, and then allow the user to make moves until they hit a mine. However, there are some differences in the details of how they implement these steps.

1. Class Structure: The C# version uses a `Game` class to encapsulate the game logic, while the Java version puts all the game logic in the `main` method. This makes the C# version more modular and easier to extend or modify.

2. Board Initialization: In the C# version, the board is initialized with a specific number of mines, which are placed randomly. In the Java version, each cell has a 1 in 7 chance of being a mine, so the number of mines can vary from game to game.

3. User Input: Both versions ask the user to enter a row and column number for their move, but the Java version subtracts 1 from these numbers to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing.

4. Displaying the Board: The C# version uses a `PrintBoard` method to display the current state of the game board, showing revealed cells and hiding unrevealed ones. The Java version prints the board directly in the main game loop, and does not hide unrevealed cells.

5. Counting Mines: Both versions count the number of mines in the cells adjacent to the user's move. However, the C# version uses a separate `CountMines` method for this, while the Java version does it directly in the main game loop.

6. Language Features: The C# version uses 2D arrays to represent the game board and the revealed cells, while the Java version uses 2D char arrays. The C# version uses the `Console` class for input and output, while the Java version uses `Scanner` for input and `System.out.print` for output. The C# version uses `Random` to place the mines, while the Java version uses `Random.nextInt`.
